# Local Font Configuration

This project uses the Satoshi font locally.

- The font files (`.woff2`) are stored in the [app/fonts/](mdc:app/fonts) directory.
- These fonts are loaded and configured using `next/font/local` within the main layout file: [app/layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx).
- The paths specified in the `localFont` configuration within `app/layout.tsx` are relative to the `app` directory (e.g., `fonts/Satoshi-Regular.woff2`).
