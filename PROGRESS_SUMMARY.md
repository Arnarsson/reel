# Project Progress Summary

Based on our recent work ("Cleaning Up MCP Servers" conversation), here's what we've accomplished:

*   **Resolved Font Issues:** Identified and fixed issues with font paths that were causing build failures during Vercel deployment.
*   **Restructured Font Files:** Moved local font files from `public/fonts` to `app/fonts` for better organization within the Next.js app router structure.
*   **Updated Layout Configuration:** Modified `app/layout.tsx` to correctly reference the fonts from their new location in `app/fonts`.
*   **Successful Vercel Deployment:** Confirmed that the project now builds and deploys successfully to Vercel after the font fixes.
*   **Documented Processes:** Created Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to document:
    *   The correct setup for using local fonts within the `app` directory (`local-fonts-setup.mdc`).
    *   The deployment workflow involving Git and Vercel (`deployment-process.mdc`).
